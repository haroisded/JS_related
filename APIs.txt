- - - ( API / APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE ) - - -

- a set of tools, rules, protocols & procedures that allows different
  software systems to communicate w/ each other

- It's made for programmer's to use & extend in their applications   

- They provide programmer's the means of controlling 
  interactions, while abstracting how they work 

- Most API's are local to the code base( they exist within the code )
  that are used to avoid in recreating the wheel



** ( Frameworks ):

- they provide an API that allows a user to extend what has been 
  provided to make it your own 

- While the inner workings are abstracted, you only need 
  to know how to write the code the framework expects 
  ( Specific Rules / Format of how the framework must be used )


( Example ):

- Web frameworks

  provides users the ability to add a new route to 
  their "Web Application"

  which allows to write out dynamic data to a template
  which a user specified, which you can do in a few lines 
  of code 



** ( Local APIs ): 

- Exist within your codebase, they help avoid "recreating the wheel" and abstract away work

- ( Examples of Local APIs ): 
• programming language 
• string methods 
• libraries
• frameworks



** ( Remote APIs ): 

- Are not executed locally in your codebase. 

- They allow remote control of objects or access to data/computational power beyond your local device.


- ( Examples of Remote APIs ): 
• Remote control ( TV )   
• robot commands
• traffic sign changes
• drone control
• music recognition apps (Shazam)
• Google Translate AR app


- ( Benefits of Remote APIs ): 
• Access to vast data (e.g., "Cloud")
• computational power 



** ( REST APIs ):

- REST / Representational State Transfer, It describes how softwares communicate over the web (the internet)
  This is done by making requests similar to how a web browser requests a webpage, but the response is JSON instead of HTML. 

- Instead of HTML (like for websites), REST APIs primarily use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). 

- they're stateless, meaning the server doesn't keep any client information between requests.

STATEFUL: The server (not just "the system") remembers and understands the user's previous interactions.
STATELESS: The server doesn't remember. The client is responsible for providing the server with all necessary information about its current state and for each request.


Absolutely — here's a cleaner, more concise version of your explanation without losing the core ideas:



** ( URLs ):

- ( Base URL ):
• The main address where the API lives online.
• It’s like the home or root of the API.

( Example ):
• https://api.example.com/v1



- ( Endpoints ):
• Paths added to the base URL to access specific resources or actions.

( Example ):
• /users/25 — retrieves user with ID 25
• /products — list or create products


- ( Combined ):
• https://api.example.com/v1/users/25



** ( Why Use APIs? ):

- ( Security ):
• APIs act as a layer between the client and the database, exposing only specific, controlled data — keeping sensitive info hidden from users (e.g., in viewable JavaScript code).

- ( Versatility ):
• One API can serve multiple platforms (web, mobile, desktop), keeping data consistent across all applications.

- ( Modularity ):
• APIs separate the frontend from the backend through a stable interface. This allows teams to update or replace backend technologies without affecting the client, as long as the API stays consistent.

- ( Interoperability ):
• Public APIs let third-party developers build on your services. Private APIs support internal integration with proper authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0).

- ( Automation ):
• APIs enable systems to communicate and trigger actions automatically ( like bots executing trades or services syncing data )
