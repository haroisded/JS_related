- - - ( "this" keyword ) - - - 

- The very purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript is to give functions 
  a way to access the object that called them ( the current context ) 

• In an object method, "this" refers to the object.
• Alone, "this" refers to the global object.
• In a function, "this" refers to the global object.
• In a function, in strict mode, "this" is undefined.
• In an event, "this" refers to the element that received the event.
• Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer "this" to any object.
