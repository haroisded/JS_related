- - - ( NPM / Node Package Manager ) - - -


*** ( What is NPM ):

- a main package manager for Node JS & is a huge 
  repository of open source software ( mostly )

- NPM makes writing code easier, because it 
  lets you use pre-built code instead of making 
  your own

• Authors will write code for their package 
• Publish it on the NPM registry
• Then you can install that package in your 
  own computer w/ the CLI



*** ( NPM Package Installation ):

- there are 2 ways of installing packages,
  Locally & Globally 

• Installing a package locally will only be 
  accessible ( & stored ) on the folder where it was installed
{ Command }: "npm install <package>" 
  
• Globally is self explanatory, it can be 
  accessed no matter what directory 
{ Command }: "npm install -g <package>" 



*** ( Package.json ):

- The package json file, store info
  about your projects 

- They can be helpful in tracking the packages 
  you've installed in your project 

- Package.json files are usually created first 
  before downloading any packages 

- It can also be useful for project cloning & get all 
  the packages that the project ( that will be cloned ) used 
  
  they can use the package json file to install all packages 
  all at once


** ( Example Process ):
• "npm install" ( in folder that has package.json )
• npm reads the file 
• npm automatically installs all packages listed on the file 


- its crucial to create a package.json when creating a new project


** ( Example Command in creating a package.json ):
• "npm init" ( manually fill out your info & create the file )
• "npm init -y" ( automatically fill out your info & create the file )

Note: you can always change the information of the file anytime 



*** ( The PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON FILE ):  

- When you install packages using npm install and rely only on package.json, 
  version numbers are often prefixed with a "caret ^" or "tilde ~":

- If someone clones your project and runs npm install, they could install 
  newer minor or patch versions of dependencies you didn't originally use. 
 
- The package-lock.json file locks down the exact versions of every package ( & their dependencies ), 
  ensuring everyone who installs the project gets the same, tested environment.
 
- if package-lock.json is present, npm installs the exact versions from the lock file, 
  not the latest allowed by package.json.


  
*** ( Dealing w/ Dependencies  ):

- after installing a package in your project folder,
  it will be listed in your package.json file in the
  "dependencies" or as a "dependency"

  this means, you can use functions from 
  the package ( you installed ) in your code   

- then after installation, a "node_modules" directory is created 
  ( it's where npm stores all package files that was installed )

- in the node moduels, their are packages that came along, after installing a package.
  they're "packages" that the "package you installed" also uses  



*** ( Dependency Versions & Updates ):  

- Versioning & Updating is important in npm,
  since a pacakge also uses packages, 
  
  if the package versions you installed aren't update, 
  then they might break your code 


** ( The Version Number Meaning ):

- 1.0.0, the first public release 

- NPM packages version numbers aren't random,
  they follow semantic versioning, a system of
  numbering software versions   

( The number versions ):

- a number may contain three digits, symbolising 
  versions & is seperated by a dot


{ Example: } ^11.11.11

• 1st Digit: Major Version
• 2nd Digit: Minor Version
• 3rd Digit: Patch Version   

- Major Updates, 
• Used for big changes 
• Not Backwards compatible ( can't work in older versions using it )
• Updating w/ this version, mostly breaks old code 

- Minor Updates, 
• New features that are Backwards compatible ( can work in older versions using it ) 
• Updating w/ this version, Won't break older builds ( IDEALLY )

- Patch Updates, 
• SMALL BUG FIXES 
• Doesn't break anything 


** ( How you View & Update packages ):

{ CMD }:  "npm view <package> versions"
{ What is it? }: views all the versions of the specific package 

- the "^" symbol, simply means there is "a new version" 
  of that package, in which you can use { CMD }: "npm update" 
  to update the package to that version 
  ( but it won't update if the new version is "MAJOR" )

- { CMD }: "npm update" only updates packages w/ "Minor updates", for "MAJOR" ones you use...

• { CMD }: "npm install <package>@latest"
• { CMD }: "npm install <package>@<version>" ( this also works for older versions )
• { CMD }: "npm install <package>@~<2.2>" ( installs the lastest patch within the 2.2 or whatever number )



*** ( NPM Cheat sheet ):
