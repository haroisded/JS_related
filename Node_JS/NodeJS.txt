** ( Introduction ):

- What is Node.js and how does it work? 
- Installation, setup, package.json, npm, etc
- Modules import/export (CommonJS & ES Modules)
- HTTP Module, req/res, routing, serving JSON/HTML 
- Custom middleware
- Other Core Modules - fs, path, url, events, process, os



** ( What is Node.js and how does it work? ):

* ( V8 JS engine ):

- Node JS is built on top of the V8 JS engine 
 ( the same engine that powers Google Chrome )

 the V8 JS engine is written in C++ & it takes 
 your JS Code -> converts -> machine code 

 Node uses the engine, extends it to work in the server side 


* ( Non - Blocking ):

- Node JS is non blocking, meaning it doesn't wait for I/O operations 
 ( e.g.. Network Calls, File System Operations, Database Operations )

 instead of blocking the execution of code, Node JS uses events & callbacks,
 that allows to handle multiple connections at the same time 


* ( Single Threaded ):

- Node JS only has a single main thread that executes your JS code

 Thread, is a set of instructions your computer executes

 in a single thread environment, there's only one set of instructions,
 that are executed at a time 

 This differs from multi-threaded environments, where you have multiple threads,
 that can execute different parts of your code simultaneously 


* ( Event Loop ):

- Node JS uses the event loop, that allows node to 
  perform none blocking or asynchronous I/O operations 

( Example ):
 
• Make Network requests
• Node.JS doesn't wait for the network request 
  process to complete 

• Rests of the code goes on ( uninterrupted by the 1st request )
• If request is complete, it triggers the "callback",
  which is now then added to the Event Queue
• Event Loop picks up the "callback", then executes it 

   
* ( What is Node.js and used for? ):

- ( Building API's, e.g.. ):
• RESTFUL api's
• graphql api's

- ( Server rendered apps, e.g.. ):
• can serve JSON data  
• can serve HTML pages
• use different template engines ( e.g.. ejs, mustache )

- ( Real - time applications, e.g.. ):
• Chat
• Realtime Games 
• Collaboration Tools 

- ( Microservices ):
• Small Independent Services, that work together 

- ( CLI / Command Line Tools ): 
• Command Line Interfaces 

- ( Bots, e.g.. ):
• Twitter Bot
• Slack Bot
• Discord Bot 

- ( Web Servers, e.g.. ):
• sophisticated web server handling
• complex routing 
• serving dynamic content 
• simple static file server 

- ( Web Scraping )


* ( What is Node.JS not great for? ):

• CPU - intensive tasks operations 



** ( Installation, setup, package.json, npm, etc.. ):

* ( Installation ):

- Node comes with a REPL / Read, Eval, Print & Loop,
  a command line environtment to run Javascript or Type  

- Note: Just Search NVM github for the installation part 

- Note: NPM & others is explained in a separate file ( NPM&CheatSheet.json )



** ( Modules import/export (CommonJS & ES Modules) ):

- allows import & export variables or functions in & from different files 

- Note: for non local modules, " ./ " should not be used  



( Example of CommonJS syntax ):

• Export:

module.exports = { SayHello, SayMessage };


• Import:

const { SayHello, SayMessage } = require('./try1');



( Example of ES Modules syntax ):

- you can use default on a function, that allows the importer
  to name the function exported / imported function
  ( but only one default per file is only allowed )

- before using this syntax, in the package.json file,
  you must add ( if not present ) a type property which will show 2 values 
  commonjs & module ( if present, just change the type value )


• Export:

export { SayHello, SayMessage };

or default version: 
export default SayHello;


• Import:

import { SayHello, SayMessage } from './try1.js';

or default version:
import Greet from './try1.js';
